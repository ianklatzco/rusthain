- goal: ian learns rust by teaching, many others learn
- should outlast me
- should run twice monthly

- 26 alphabetical cutesy exercises
- do a year of it every 2wks
- probably incompatible with my travel schedule but can probably socialize
  it to get others making stuff
- alphabetical / cutesy not necessarily the template that best communicates

- "here are some syntax basics" as the first exercise
    -  hello world pattern from sigpwny
- "here's a cool library" seems more likely for later stuff
- "here's the hello world exercise for a cool library"
- this starts maybe requiring separate cargotomls?

- could attempt to produce a rustlings-like that is cutesy poemy x26
- could attempt to produce a social framework at xhain that is producing
  rust learning exercises according to a social template a la sigpwny 15/45
    - this is probably highest leverage, socializing the learning
	- discord almost certainly a better platform
