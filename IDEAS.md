- goal: ian learns rust by teaching, many others learn
- should outlast me
- should run twice monthly

- 26 alphabetical cutesy exercises
- do a year of it every 2wks
- probably incompatible with my travel schedule but can probably socialize
  it to get others making stuff
- alphabetical / cutesy not necessarily the template that best communicates

- "here are some syntax basics" as the first exercise
    -  hello world pattern from sigpwny
- "here's a cool library" seems more likely for later stuff
- "here's the hello world exercise for a cool library"
- this starts maybe requiring separate cargotomls?

- could attempt to produce a rustlings-like that is cutesy poemy x26
- could attempt to produce a social framework at xhain that is producing
  rust learning exercises according to a social template a la sigpwny 15/45
    - this is probably highest leverage, socializing the learning
	- discord almost certainly a better platform

- either i can do a bunch of these as a continual sequence
- it probably makes the most sense to do the sigpwny-style exercise wherein 
- an interested party makes 3-5: hello, easy, medium, hard
- which maximizes the learning of the person organizing
- i probably have to be present to support the person learning?

- cargo build should always succeed
- cargo test should fail up until the point of your progress
- should probably have subdirs with specific cargotomls for different dependencies
- goal: produce exercises to gently introduce someone to whatever library interests the challenge author
